[.z.....]
The classroom is filled with the murmur of students and the clatter of pens.[.a.abaa]
At the back of the classroom, disinterest is evident as Shahid doodles absentmindedly in his notebook. His grades, scattered on the desk beside him, reflect his lack of motivation.[a.b....]
Despite his apparent disengagement, Shahid's gaze frequently drifts across the room.[b.c....]
His eyes are drawn to Maria, seated at the front, effortlessly acing her assignments and chatting with her friends.[.b.....]
Her elegance and confidence shine through, making her the center of attention.
A glance is stolen by Shahid towards Maria, who is laughing with Annie.[b.c....]
Noticing this, Josh nudges him.[a.d....]
Josh (Grinning): Dude, you’ve been staring at Maria for the past five minutes. You planning to make her your personal study guide?
Shahid(Blushing, trying to act nonchalant): WHAT?! I am just staring into space...thinking...
Josh: Thinking, huh? If you’re thinking about Maria, you’re not the only one. Just make sure you don’t get too lost in that daydream of yours.
Shahid (Annoyed): Hey, can you not?
Josh: But you know... She’s really something, isn’t she? 
Josh: Something’s one way to put it. She’s a walking, talking dream. But you’ve got to remember, dude, you can’t just sit here dreaming about her. 
Josh: She’s out there doing amazing stuff while you’re, well, here.
Shahid (defensive, but with a hint of longing): I know. It’s just… it’s hard not to notice how perfect she seems.
Josh (grinning): Perfect, huh? Well, if you want to get her attention, maybe you should try doing something that’s not just staring. 
Josh: How about joining the orchestra or showing up at one of her violin performances?
Shahid (sighing): Yeah, maybe. But it’s not that simple.
Josh (leaning in): Nothing worth doing ever is. Just don’t let the chance slip by because you were too busy daydreaming.
The sound of Maria's laughter with her friends captures Shahid's attention again, her happiness evident.[b.c....]
Thoughts of Josh's advice linger as the idea of stepping out of his comfort zone begins to take hold.[.a.....]
The bell rings, and MR. JOHN walks in, carrying a stack of papers. The students settle down.[.e...bb]
John: Good morning, class. Today, I have an important announcement. We’ll be working on a final year project—this time, in pairs.
Excitement murmurs through the class. Josh immediately turns to Shahid.[d.a....]
Josh(Excited): Pair up with me, bro?
Shahid(Nods, not looking at JOSH): Sure, sounds good.
As the rest of the class rush to find their pair, Josh and Shahid simply spent the time chilling at Shahid's desk.[a.d....]
After some time, when everyone got into their pairs, John announced a surprise.[.e.....]
John: Alright! Now, there’s more. For this project, I want each pair to work with another pair to form a group of four.
John: This will help you tackle the challenge of building a bridge using any recycled materials, applying the physics concepts we’ve covered.
The students exchange curious looks. SHAHD seems disappointed, while MARIA appears focused and determined.[.a.....]
As the class buzzes with anticipation, Shahid seems worried as he has to interact with his classmates whom he probably has never spoken to before.
Later, the classroom is buzzing with noise as students form groups. JOHN calls out the pairs.[.e.....]
John: Now...
John: Marcus and Ryan, you’ll be joining Luke and Iona.
John: Karen and Jamie, you’ll be joining Ben and Chris.
John: Shahid and Josh, you’ll be joining Maria and Annie.
Shahid’s eyes widen as MARIA and ANNIE approach. SHAHD’s face turns red, and he tries to hide his discomfort.[.a.....]
Annie(Smiling): Hey, Shahid. Looks like we’re together for this one![.c.....]
Maria(Nods politely): Hi, Shahid. Hi, Josh.[b.c....]
Josh(Cheerful): Hey, Maria! Ready to build the best bridge ever?[.d.....]
Shahid(Mumbling): Yeah… sure.[a.d....]
As the groups form and the project begins, Shahid finds himself tangled in a web of shyness and unspoken affection.[.a.....]
The project, which was meant to bridge gaps, now threatens to expose his insecurities.
At JOSH’s house later that evening.[...bcc.]
While playing video games, Shahid glances at the clock with a distracted expression.[.a.....]
Shahid(Glancing at the window): Hey, Josh, isn’t Mr. John still at school?
Josh(Focused on the game): Yeah, he’s been staying late a lot lately. I guess he has a lot to do.[a.d....]
Shahid(Nods): Must be rough. I wonder what he’s working on.
Josh(Casually): Probably just prepping for classes or grading. He’s always so dedicated.
Josh: Hey...You should really use this opportunity to get closer to Maria ya...
Shahid: What?! What for?
Josh(Grinning): Come on, Shahid. You’ve been eyeing her for ages. This project is your chance to actually talk to her, work together.
Josh: You might even impress her if you play your cards right.
Shahid(Looking uncomfortable): I don’t know, Josh. What if I mess up? What if she doesn’t even want to talk to me?
Josh(Encouragingly): Hey, just be yourself. It’s not like you have to be perfect. Besides, you’ve got me to help you out. And Maria? She’s smart. She’ll appreciate someone who tries.
Shahid(Sighing): I guess. But what if she doesn’t like me?
Josh(Shrugging): You’ll never know if you don’t try. And hey, it’s not just about impressing her. It’s about getting to know her and working together on something. It could be fun.
Shahid(Reluctantly): Okay, okay. I’ll try to make an effort.
Josh(Pats Shahid on the back): That’s the spirit! And remember, it’s just a project. Focus on the work, and the rest will follow.
As Shahid reluctantly agrees to step out of his comfort zone.[.a.....]
He begins to realize that this project might be more than just a task—it could be an opportunity to build connections, both academically and personally.
The next day in the classroom. The students are gathered in their newly formed groups, discussing their project. SHAHID is visibly nervous but makes an effort to participate.[.a.abaa]
Shahid(Clearing his throat): So, uh, what do you think about starting with a basic design and then adding layers to test its stability?
Josh: Great idea, Shahid. We can definitely work with that. Maria, Annie, any thoughts?[.d.....]
Annie(Enthusiastically): Great idea! Let’s draw up some sketches and figure out the materials we’ll need.[b.c....]
Maria(Nodding): That sounds like a good plan. We can sketch out some ideas and see how they hold up under different weights.
Annie: Yes, let’s sketch out some designs and see how we can incorporate Shahid’s idea.
Shahid’s face flushes with embarrassment as he struggles to contribute, feeling overshadowed by Maria’s confident presence.[.a.....]
The group meeting continues with Shahid remaining largely silent, his attempts to engage feeling increasingly futile.
In the following meetings, Shahid makes a determined effort to contribute more. He tries to speak up, but often feels his ideas fall short compared to Maria’s expertise.
Shahid (trying to sound more confident): How about we consider using different types of bracing for the bridge? Maybe triangular supports could improve stability.
Maria (nodding, considering): That’s an interesting suggestion. We should definitely explore different bracing options. Let’s work on some sketches.[a.b....]
Annie (encouragingly): Sounds good. Shahid, why don’t you start on the sketches while we gather some more materials?[a.c....]
Despite Shahid’s frustration, Josh remains a source of encouragement.[.a.....]
Josh (supportively, patting Shahid on the back): Don’t get disheartened, man. You’re doing great. Keep pushing your ideas, and remember, we’re all here to help each other.[a.d....]
Shahid (sighing, but determined): Yeah, thanks, Josh. I’ll keep at it.
As the days go by, Shahid’s efforts start to make a noticeable difference. He grows more engaged, and his contributions begin to complement the group’s progress.[.......]
During a group meeting in Physics class, Annie announces the need for volunteers to buy materials for the bridge project.[.c.....]
Annie: We need someone to pick up the materials from the mall. It’s a lot of stuff, so it would be helpful to have someone strong and reliable.
Shahid, feeling a surge of determination and a desire to prove himself, immediately volunteers.[.a.....]
Shahid (eagerly): I’ll go! I can handle it.
Annie: It’s quite a bit to carry alone, though. Are you sure you can manage? Maybe...[a.c....]
Maria, noticing Shahid’s eagerness and the potential challenge, quickly volunteers to help.[.b.....]
Maria (warmly): I’ll go with him. We can make it easier if we work together.
As they prepare to leave, Josh gives Shahid a knowing smirk, clearly amused by the situation.[d.a....]
Josh (smirking and whispering): Good luck, Shahid. This could be your chance to impress Maria.
Shahid (nervously, trying to smile): Yeah, thanks, Josh. I’ll do my best.
Shahid and Maria head to the mall together, their interaction was filled with the awkwardness of newfound closeness.[a.bcd..]
The initial silence between them is palpable, and Shahid struggles to find the right words.
Maria, sensing his discomfort, takes the lead in the conversation.
Maria (cheerfully, trying to break the ice): So, Shahid, have you been working on any other projects lately, or is this the only one on your plate?
Shahid (awkwardly, glancing around): Uh, not really. Just this project and... some other stuff. Mostly just schoolwork, you know?
Maria (nodding, smiling): I get it. School can be pretty overwhelming sometimes. I’ve been busy with a few extracurriculars too. I’m actually part of the debate team, so that keeps me on my toes.
Shahid (trying to stay engaged, but struggling): Oh, that sounds... intense. I don’t really do much outside of class, to be honest.
As they walk through the aisles, Shahid focuses on the list of materials, while Maria continues to fill the silence with her observations.
Maria (Picks up a pack of glue sticks): These should work for our project. What do you think?
Shahid (Nods, trying to sound enthusiastic) Yeah, that should be good.
Maria (Notices Shahid’s discomfort): You seem a bit quiet today. Everything okay?
Shahid (Looks away): Ya.
Maria (Growing frustrated): Hey, what is it? Do you have an issue with me?
Shahid (Startled, stumbling over his words): What? I don’t—I don’t have an issue with you!
Maria (Annoyed): It seems like you do. You’ve been so quiet and distant. Are you trying to avoid me or something?
Shahid (Flustered): No, that’s not it at all. I... I just don’t know what to say. I’m not good at this whole talking-to-you thing.
Maria (Confused): Talking-to-me thing? Why would you have trouble talking to me? What’s going on?
Shahid (Embarrassed, trying to explain): It’s just... I’ve always looked up to you, Maria. You’re so confident and... I feel like I don’t belong in the same world as you. 
Shahid: I guess I’m just afraid of saying something wrong.
Maria (Softening slightly, and a little flustered): Oh. I didn’t realize you felt that way...Thanks...I thought you were just mad at me for some reason.
Shahid (Relieved, but still nervous): No, I’m not mad at you. I’m just... really shy and worried about messing things up.
Maria (Sighing): Well, you don’t have to worry about that. I’m just here to work on this project like everyone else. You don’t have to impress me—just be yourself.
Maria (Raises an eyebrow, amused): And you’re Shahid. Just a regular student like the rest of us.
Shahid (Blushing): I guess. It’s just that you’re always so... amazing and involved. I feel like I’m always just in the background.
Maria (Gently): Well, everyone has their strengths. I’m sure you have yours too. It’s okay to not be the best at everything. What matters is that you’re trying.
Shahid (Surprised by her kindness): Thanks, Maria. I really appreciate that. I guess I just feel like I’m not contributing enough to the project or... to the group.
Maria (Encouragingly): You’ve been making a lot of effort, though. Your ideas are actually pretty good. Sometimes it takes a little while to find your rhythm.
Shahid (Hesitant): You really think so?
Maria (Smiling): Absolutely. I can see you’re passionate about the project, and that’s what counts. Plus, everyone’s contributions help in different ways.
Shahid (Relaxing a bit): That’s good to hear. I guess I’ve been so focused on trying to impress everyone that I forgot to just... be myself.
Maria (Nods): Exactly. And being yourself is more than enough. If you ever need help or just someone to talk to, don’t hesitate to ask. We’re all in this together.
Shahid (Feeling encouraged): Thanks, Maria. That really means a lot.
Later that evening, Shahid and Maria decided to grab dinner together.[...d...]
During dinner, the mood relaxed and comfortable. The earlier tension has melted away, replaced by an easy camaraderie.[a.b....]
Maria (smiling, taking a bite of her food): So, Shahid, what do you like to do when you’re not buried in schoolwork?
Shahid (grinning, more relaxed than before): Well, I’m really into video games. Josh and I have these epic gaming sessions. It’s kind of my escape from all the stress.
Maria (interested): That sounds fun! I’ve heard a lot about gaming but never really got into it myself. Maybe you could teach me sometime?
Shahid (enthusiastically): I’d love to! We could set up a game night. I’ll even let you pick the game.
Maria (laughing): That sounds like a plan. And who knows, maybe you’ll convert me into a gamer.
Shahid (smiling widely): I’ll take that as a challenge. But fair warning, I can be pretty competitive.
Maria (playfully): Oh, I’ll keep that in mind. I might have to bring my A-game.
As they continue to chat and enjoy their meal, Shahid can’t help but feel that the evening has been the best part of his day.[.a.....]
His earlier anxieties seem distant, replaced by a genuine connection with Maria.
Back at home, Shahid is lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, a contented smile on his face. His phone buzzes with a text from Maria.[.a.ee..]
Maria(Text): Hey Shahid, I had a great time today. Thanks for hanging out. Looking forward to our next project meeting :)
A wide smile appears on Shahid’s face as he types a reply.
Shahid’s Text: Me too, Maria. I had a lot of fun. Let’s make sure we keep up the good work :)
He sets his phone down, feeling a warmth in his chest. The day has been a turning point for him, and he looks forward to what comes next with Maria.
As he drifts off to sleep, he can’t help but feel hopeful about the future.[.......]
The next day in school begins with a newfound energy in Shahid. Shahid has never been seen so enthusiastic before.[.a.ab..]
As Shahid entered the class, he was greeted by Maria.[a.b....]
Maria (smiling): Morning, Shahid! Were you gaming all night again?
Shahid (excitedly): Good morning, Maria! No, I was busy finishing the homework due later...
Their conversation flowing naturally. Shahid's shyness from before seems to have diminished, replaced by a genuine smile and engaged demeanor.
As they talk, Josh (playful grin on his face) approaches.[.d.....]
Josh (teasingly): Well, well, look at you two. I guess you’ve found your groove, Shahid. Just don’t forget about me.
Shahid (flustered): What do you mean? I’m still here.[a.d....]
Maria (giggling): Hey! I’m not going to steal your bestie from you...[b.d....]
Annie, clinging to Maria, joins in.[b.c....]
Annie: I hope you’re not planning to do the same, Shahid.
Shahid’s face turns red as he walks to his seat, trying to keep himself busy.[.a.....]
Maria approaches him.[.b.....]
Maria: Hey, don’t let them tease you like that. Remember what I said yesterday? Just be yourself, and treat me like you would anyone else.[a.b....]
Shahid: Yeah, I know... Sorry about that.
Shahid: By the way, would you and Annie be interested in going out for dinner with us after our project group meeting later?
Maria: Sure, I’ll let Annie know. You let Josh know ya. 
Just then, Mr. John walks into the classroom and calls for Maria.[.e....b]
John: Maria, may I have a minute?
Maria: Yes, Mr. John![b.e....]
As Maria goes to speak with John, Josh continues to tease Shahid.[.d.....]
Josh (playfully): So, how was yesterday?[a.d....]
Shahid (with a shrug): Nothing much, really. I felt like a loser half the time. Nothing to brag about.
Josh: Come on! It’s almost every guy’s dream to go on a date with Maria.
Shahid (rolling his eyes): That’s definitely not a date! Anyway, let’s have dinner with the project group—just us four—after the meeting later.
Josh: Oooooh, too shy for a date for two? Sure.
As the bell rings, signaling the start of class, Shahid tries to concentrate on the lesson.[.a....a]
Maria returns and takes her seat, giving Shahid a reassuring smile. Shahid feels a sense of relief and excitement as he prepares for the group meeting later.[a.b....]
Later that day, after school, the project group assembles in a classroom to finalize their bridge design.[.......]
As the group works on the project, Shahid finds himself more engaged and confident.[...f...]
The atmosphere is light, with everyone contributing their ideas and enjoying the task.
Annie (looking at her watch): We should wrap up here if we want to make it to dinner on time.[.c.....]
Maria (nodding): Agreed. Let’s start cleaning up.[b.c....]
Maria: Actually, I might have to pass for dinner. It is getting pretty late and I have to rush to get some things to settled soon. Sorry guys. Let's have dinner another time.[.b.....]
Shahid: Hey, no worries. We will see you tomorrow. We shall have another dinner together another time.[a.b....]
Maria: Sorry again guys. See yall tomorrow![.b.....]
Maria rushed to leave the room as the remaining three look at each other.[......c]
Shahid: Is she always this busy?[.a.....]
Annie: Yeah. Her schedule seems to only get busier everyday.[a.c....]
Annie: Well...Looks like it will just be the three of us for dinner.[.c.....]
Josh: Looking sad ya Shahid?[.d.....]
Shahid: Shut up. Let's go before the security chase us out.[a.d....]
At a cozy, local diner. The trio is seated at a booth, and their plates are filled with various comfort foods. The atmosphere is relaxed.[...gd..]
Josh (chewing thoughtfully): So, how about that bridge, huh? We're actually making some serious progress.[.d.....]
Annie (nodding): Definitely. I think we’re on the right track. It’s just too bad Maria couldn’t make it tonight.[d.c....]
Josh (grinning): Yeah, she’s a bit of a whirlwind, isn’t she? Always off to some important thing or another.
Annie (sighing): True. 
Annie: She’s always got something going on—whether it’s practice for an orchestra concert, a scholarship program, or just studying for her third language. 
Annie: It’s like she never has any downtime.
Shahid (picking at his food): Yeah, I’ve noticed. She’s really dedicated to everything she does. Sometimes I wonder how she manages to keep up with it all.[.a.....]
Josh (casually): I guess that’s why she’s always so impressive. But it must be exhausting for her. I can’t imagine being that busy all the time.[a.d....]
Annie (thoughtfully): It is. I think that’s why she sometimes has to miss out on things like our dinner. She’s just got so much on her plate.[.c.....]
Shahid (nodding): Makes sense.[.a.....]
The conversation continues, with Josh and Annie discussing their schoolwork and other activities. [.......]
Occasionally contributing to the discussion, Shahid listens attentively.
Later, as they leave the diner, Shahid and Annie find themselves walking in the same direction towards the train station.[...hg..]
Shahid (glancing at Annie): So, I didn’t realize you lived so close to me.[a.c....]
Annie (nodding): Yeah, I’ve been living around here for a while. I guess we never really talked about where we live.
Shahid (smiling): It’s kind of nice, actually. It’s a bit of a coincidence, don’t you think?
Annie (smiling back): Yeah, it is.
They board the train and find seats, the train pulling out of the station. The ride is quiet, both lost in their thoughts.[a.ci.d.]
As the train approaches Annie’s station, she turns to Shahid.
Annie (hesitantly): You know, Shahid, you’re really into Maria, aren’t you?
Shahid’s face turns red, and he fidgets nervously.
Shahid (stammering): W-what? No! I am not! Why did you ask?
Annie (smiling gently): It’s obvious. I’ve seen the way you look at her. You’re really making an effort.
The train comes to a stop at Annie’s station.
Annie (standing up): Anyway, I should get going. See you tomorrow, Shahid.
Shahid (nodding): Yeah, see you tomorrow, Annie.
As Annie exits the train, she waves goodbye, and Shahid watches her leave. He feels a mix of relief and concern about the situation.[.a.....]
At home, Shahid is sitting at his desk. [.a.eec.]
His phone buzzes with a message from Maria. Shahid opens it with a smile.
Maria(text): Hey Shahid, sorry again for missing dinner. How was it?
Shahid(typing back): It went well! Annie and Josh and I had a good time. We missed you though. Hopefully, we can catch up soon.
Maria’s Message: I’m glad to hear that! I really wish I could have made it. Let’s try to plan something soon. Keep up the great work with the project!
Shahid puts his phone down and gets back to studying with a smile on his face.
Shahid feels like things are still looking up.
The next day, after another project meeting, Shahid approached Maria.[.a.ab..]
Shahid (trying again): Hey Maria, we’re heading out for dinner after this. You in?[.a.a...]
Maria (distractedly): I wish I could, but I have a violin exam coming up, and I need to study. Maybe some other time?[a.b....]
Shahid (nodding, trying to stay positive): Yeah, that’s okay. We’ll find another time.
A few days later, at the school library after a project meeting.[.......]
Shahid (approaching Maria with a hopeful expression): Dinner tonight?[a.bf...]
Maria (looking stressed): I’m really sorry, Shahid. I have a scholarship program meeting later. It’s just a really busy week.
Shahid (forcing a smile): I understand. We’ll make plans another time.
As the days go by, Shahid starts feeling the strain of his efforts. He finds himself spending more time with Josh and Annie.[...a...]
The next few days in school, Shahid’s efforts to invite Maria for dinner after their project meetings continue, but Maria often has conflicting commitments.
In the school library, Shahid, Josh, and Annie are working on their project.[...j...]
Josh (noticing Shahid’s mood and whispering): You seem a bit down, man. Everything alright?[a.d....]
Shahid(turning his frown upside down): Yeah! What's up?
Josh: You should really look at yourself in the mirror. You look dead...
Shahid: Oh... but I am really feeling ok.
Josh: Haizzzz... Come on! Your world should not revolve around a single girl you know?
Shahid: Hey! I am not bothered by her absence. I am fine. Thanks for worrying.
Josh: Ok fine. If you say so.
After the project meeting, Shahid finds himself going home in the same direction as Annie again.
They head towards the train station, without much chatting.
Shahid (trying to fill the silence): Another meeting without Maria. It feels like she’s always busy with something.
Annie (nodding sympathetically, with a hint of concern): Yeah, she’s got a lot on her plate. But you’ve been doing well with the project, Shahid.
Annie: I see your efforts in trying to get closer to Maria too! Just admit that you are into her already!
Shahid (rubbing the back of his neck, looking down): Ah...It’s just... 
Shahid is tired of hiding his feelings for Maria. With a mixture of determination and uncertainty, Shahid decided it was time to seek out Annie's help. 
Shahid hopes that, through Annie’s insights, he could finally find a way to close the distance that had grown between him and Maria, whom he admired so much.
Shahid: I guess there's no point in hiding anymore...
Shahid: I feel like I’m putting in all this effort and it’s not making a difference. I want to get closer to Maria, but it’s tough.
Annie (placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder): Yes, I understand. She’s very driven and dedicated. Sometimes, it’s hard to keep up.
Shahid (looking up with a frown, voice tinged with frustration): Exactly. I mean, she’s so accomplished and I feel like I’m falling short. 
Shahid: I don’t know what to do to bridge that gap.
Annie (giving him a thoughtful look, leaning in slightly): Well, maybe you need to focus on yourself a bit more. 
Annie: Maria is a top scholar, so if you want to impress her, you might need to raise your own game.
Shahid (scratching his head, looking uncertain): I’ve been trying, but it’s hard. I’m not exactly the brightest student. It’s just... I don’t know where to start.
Annie (smiling encouragingly, with a gentle nod): Everyone starts somewhere. Even the top students had to begin with the basics. It’s about being consistent and motivated.
Shahid (sighing deeply, looking overwhelmed): That makes sense. But it’s overwhelming.
Annie (brightening up, with an enthusiastic tone): How about this—I can help you with some extra study sessions. 
Annie: We can meet up after school and go over some of the material together.
Shahid (eyes lighting up, a hopeful smile spreading): Really? That would be amazing. Thank you, Annie.
Annie (grinning, giving him a thumbs up): No problem. We’ll start tomorrow after school. I’ll be in the library around 3 PM. Sound good?
Shahid (nodding eagerly, with renewed energy): Perfect. I’ll be there.
The train arrives, and they board together. Annie gives Shahid an encouraging smile.
Annie (with a warm, encouraging tone): You’re taking the right steps. Just keep working at it, and you’ll improve.
Shahid (smiling gratefully, with a sense of relief): I really appreciate your help. It means a lot.
Annie (waving, as the train starts moving): Anytime. See you tomorrow!
Annie’s stop approaches, and she prepares to get off. She turns to Shahid with a final reminder.
Annie (with a playful smile): Don’t forget, library, 3 PM. Let’s make it productive.
Shahid (with a determined nod, smiling): Got it. See you then.
Shahid watches Annie leave, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. He takes a deep breath, feeling motivated as the train continues on its way.
